# Covid_19_Data_Analysis

This project explores COVID-19 data from January 2020 to October 2021. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration, I prepared relavant data visualizations in Tableau by utilizing the queries I developed in MYSQL. My dashboard in Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sai.nischith.vangala/viz/Covid19Dashboard_16950239831270/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
